# SentimentAnalysis
This project performs sentiment analysis over IMDB movie reviews and Twitter data. Goal of this project is to classify tweets or movie reviews as either positive or negative. For classification, logistic regression as well as a Naive Bayes classifier from pythonâ€™s well regarded machine learning package scikitlearn are used. To approaches have been used to generate the feature vectors:  
1.  A more traditional NLP technique where features are "important" words (based on certain criteria) and feature vectors are corresponding binary vectors.  
2.  Doc2Vec technique where document vectors are learned via artificial neural networks. ([ref](https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/modern-methods-for-sentiment-analysis))
